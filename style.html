	<h3>Narrative Techniques</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Non-linear Storytelling: Kurosawa often employed non-linear narratives, using flashbacks and multiple perspectives to tell complex stories.</li>
			<li>Epic Scale and Intimate Drama: He was adept at blending grand, sweeping narratives with personal, intimate moments, making his films emotionally resonant while also larger than life..</li>
			<li>Dialogue and Silence: Kurosawa's films feature powerful dialogue, but he also masterfully used silence to convey emotion and tension.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Influence of Japanese Culture and Literature</h3>
	      <p> Kurosawa was deeply influenced by Japanese culture, literature, and the traditions of Kabuki and Noh theater. His adaptations of Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, and other Western works reflect his ability to blend Eastern and Western storytelling traditions.</p>
